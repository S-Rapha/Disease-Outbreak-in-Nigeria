### Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying trends in disease outbreaks in Nigeria, with a specific emphasis on emerging and re-emerging diseases such as COVID-19, Mpox, and cholera. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, track outbreak dynamics, and provide insights to support public health strategies. By leveraging data visualization and exploratory techniques, this project seeks to enhance understanding of these diseases' spread, prevalence, and impact over time.

### Data Source

NCDC (Ngeria centre for disease control): the primary data was gotten from NCDC in the form of PDF.

### Tools

- Excel: data cleaning & extraction
- Power BI: Analysis and data visualization

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The following task were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing value
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring OUTBREK OF DISEASE IN NIGERIA to answer key question such as:

- Number of death caused by these pathogen

- Most affected state in Nigeria

- Month of high incidence

- Most affected age group

- How many laboratory are performing and non performing laboratory

- Test type

- Most effective preventive measure and their lack of acceptance by the public

### Findings and Insights 

1. The analysis result as summerized as follows:

2. The total number of confirmed caused by covid 19 in the year 2022 was 530k i.e from january to September

3. The total of death from covid-19 in the same year was 6k

4. The total number of recovery was 515k

5. There were higher number of recovery than death in the year 2022 from the covid-19 disease

6. There were more PCR test done than RDT in the year 2022 for the covid-19 disease

7. Most of the public laboratory were not able to carry out diagnostic test on the covid-19 pathogen

8. The year 2022 also has the highest rate of Mpox outbreak in nigeria

9. The month june has the highest incidence.

10. In the year 2024 Lagos sate has the highest rate of cholera outbreak

11. The most affected age group for the mpox outbreak in 2022 were 21-30 (young adult)

12. Moderna and Pfizer are the brand with the most efficacy to the original strain of covid-19

13. Most people rejected the covid-19 vaccine due to conspiracy theory

### Recommendations

- Public facilities should be equipped with PCR machines
- Training should be done for scientist in the public laboratory on importance of early diagnosis of viral infection
- Public health eduction should be done on advantage of vaccination in order to debunk conspiracy theory
- More research should be done on my there was high rate of mpox incidence in the year 2022
- More reseach should be done on cholera re-occurence

### Limitations

  Data gotten was not sufficient to cover the trend over many years
